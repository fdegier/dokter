Verify that build args doesn't contain sensitive information, use secret mounts instead.

Build args are stored in the history of the docker image and can be retrieved. Secret mounts are not persisted
and are therefor a better option if you temporarily need sensitive information to build your image. If sensitive
information is required during runtime of the containers, use environment variables.

Example of secure instruction:

```
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=docker_token docker login -u user -p $(cat /run/secrets/docker_token)
```

Example of insecure instruction:
```
ARG TOKEN
RUN docker login -u user -p $TOKEN
```

Autocorrect: False
