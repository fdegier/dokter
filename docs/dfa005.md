In a Docker container a root user is the same UID as root on the machine, this could be exploited. After doing
things required by root always switch back to the least privileged user.

Example of secure instruction:

```
FROM python:3.10.0
RUN useradd -D appuser && chown -R appuser /app
USER appuser
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

Example of insecure instruction:
```
FROM python:3.10.0
